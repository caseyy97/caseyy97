I'm Casey! I'm a 24 year old trans girl from Queensland, Australia.

My main interests are:

- Computer hardware and software 🖥️
- Creative writing ✍️
- Music 🎵
- Programming and web development 🌐
- Video games 🎮

I have ASD (autism spectrum disorder), so it may be difficult for me to participate in social activities, and I may need to ask more questions than normal to clarify things. As long as you're aware of and understanding of this, I'm sure we'll get along just fine. 💜

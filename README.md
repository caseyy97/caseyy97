I'm Casey! I'm a 27 year old nerdy trans puppygirl from Queensland, Australia. I love tinkering and messing around with anything in the realm of software and web development, mainly, so most of my projects will revolve around those!

Aside from that, my main interests are:

- Computer hardware and software 🖥️
- Creative writing ✍️
- Music 🎵
- Programming and web development 🌐
- Video games 🎮
